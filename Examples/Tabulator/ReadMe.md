# Installation

## Prerequisites

Node version 20.17.0 or later.

## Suggested Development Tools

VS Code v1.89.1 or later.\
Prettier VS Code Extension v10.4.0 or later.\
ESLint VS Code Extension v2.4.4 or later.

# Getting Started

1. Set up Visual Studio Code and Node, see [Development Environment](../../README.md#development-environment)
2. Open this file: ```WebpackVisualization.code-workspace```
3. Run `npm install` to install the relevant node modules

# How To Use

- src\no-guid.package.json.ejs
- src\visualizer\no-guid.visualization.config.json.ejs

> The purpose of these files is to automatically generate a unique ID for the package/tabulator.

1. Run `npm run generate-guids`

This will produce these 2 files:

- src\package.json.ejs
- src\visualizer\package.json.ejs

> The purpose of these files is to automatically increment the version number every time you build

2. Run `npm run build`

Which will produce:

- src\package.json
- src\visualizer\package.json
- versions\tabulator.zip

> These are automatically generated files which you shouldn't manually edit.

You can now import the `tabulator.zip` file in to Mood.

You should also choose a preview image by changing ```visualization.png```.

## Tabulator Demo

Run `npm run start` to run the demo-visualization on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). This will open your browser showing template.html.

The demo visualization page will reload when you make changes to the main visualization code.

Interesting files:

- TabulatorApp.js: This is where your main code lives.
- TabulatorDemo.js: Hooks the template page in to the main visualization code.
- sample-data.json: This file passes fixed test data in to your tabulator demo page.

# Test Strategy

## Testing that is currently implemented

- Jest for unit testing

## Coding Structure

Tests are grouped in describe blocks based on either functionality that they share or a component they are testing.

## How to run these tests

### Unit Tests
1. Run `npm run test .` to run all unit tests
2. Run `npm run test -- --coverage .` for the coverage of all tests

## Test Pass Rates

> visualizer, 2/2 tests pass (100% pass rate)

## Average Line Coverage

> visualizer has an average line coverage of 00.00% of all files
